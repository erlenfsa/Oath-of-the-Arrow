				"The Oath of the Arrow binds a paladin to the justice of the arrow making the usage of other weapons almost considered heresy. Following lofty ideals of justice they forsake their names and call themselves the valkyries after their founder, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct and courage, even in the face of despair, believing that a heroic death in battle is the ultimate end to their service. The valkyries incorporate angelic wings onto their helmets and in their coat of arms as a homage to the angelic wings of the First Valkyrie.",
